# CatLife Unity Import Validation - Step 1

Date: 2026-06-29

This is the first execution step for the next phase: validate that the Unity handoff project can import and play the latest CatLife cat animation package.

## Prepared Local Workspace

Local Unity validation workspace:

`C:\Users\fujunye\Desktop\Agent\05-AIGC\work\unity-import-validation-20260629`

This workspace was assembled from:

- `06-deliverables/unity-handoff-20260629/Assets_noart.zip`
- `06-deliverables/unity-handoff-20260629/Packages.zip`
- `06-deliverables/unity-handoff-20260629/ProjectSettings.zip`
- `06-deliverables/cat-animation-final-package-20260629/CatLife_cat_10_actions_final_state.fbx`
- `06-deliverables/cat-animation-final-package-20260629/cat_actions_manifest.json`
- `06-deliverables/cat-animation-final-package-20260629/cat-animation-production-notes.md`

The extracted Unity workspace now has the expected top-level structure:

```text
work/unity-import-validation-20260629/
├── Assets/
├── Packages/
└── ProjectSettings/
```

Animation files were placed at:

`work/unity-import-validation-20260629/Assets/Art/Cat/Animations/`

## Unity Version

`ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` reports:

```text
m_EditorVersion: 6000.2.5f1
m_EditorVersionWithRevision: 6000.2.5f1 (43d04cd1df69)
```

Use Unity `6000.2.5f1` first. If another Unity version opens the project, record the migration prompt/result before changing assets.

## First Validation Goal

Confirm the 10-action FBX imports into Unity and that each intended Action can be previewed or assigned without orientation, scale, or floating defects.

## Required Import Checks

| Check | Expected result |
|---|---|
| Project opens | Unity opens `work/unity-import-validation-20260629` without compile errors |
| Scenes visible | `startscene`, `mainscene`, and `FocusScene` are present under `Assets/Scenes/` |
| FBX present | `Assets/Art/Cat/Animations/CatLife_cat_10_actions_final_state.fbx` is visible in Project panel |
| Manifest present | `cat_actions_manifest.json` is next to the FBX |
| Rig orientation | Source convention is preserved: `+Z` up, head faces `-Y`, tail points `+Y` before Unity import conversion |
| Scale | Imported cat visually matches expected size; no oversized or tiny rig |
| Grounding | No action makes the cat float unexpectedly |
| Animation count | 10 intended actions are available or extractable from the FBX |
| Action 10 status | `CL_CAT_HeadShakeNo_v01_loop_108f` is marked as draft/backup until final review |

## Action List

Use `cat_actions_manifest.json` as the source of truth:

1. `CL_CAT_IdleBreath_v06_headsync_loop_108f`
2. `CL_CAT_AlertLook_v01_loop_120f`
3. `CL_CAT_PawWave_v01_loop_96f`
4. `CL_CAT_TailWagHappy_v01_loop_96f`
5. `CL_CAT_CuriousSniff_v02_loop_112f`
6. `CL_CAT_HeadTiltListen_v01_loop_96f`
7. `CL_CAT_LookBack_v02_loop_112f`
8. `CL_CAT_StretchYawn_v03_slow_loop_264f`
9. `CL_CAT_EarTwitchAlert_v02_loop_120f`
10. `CL_CAT_HeadShakeNo_v01_loop_108f`

## Manual Unity Steps

1. Open Unity Hub.
2. Add project from:
   `C:\Users\fujunye\Desktop\Agent\05-AIGC\work\unity-import-validation-20260629`
3. Open with Unity `6000.2.5f1`.
4. Wait for import and compilation.
5. Open `Assets/Art/Cat/Animations/CatLife_cat_10_actions_final_state.fbx`.
6. Inspect Rig and Animation import tabs.
7. Preview each action against the model.
8. Record result in the validation log below.

## Validation Log

| Animator mapping | Passed in validation workspace | Created `Assets/Art/Cat/Animations/CatLife_10Actions_Validation.controller` and assigned it to `Cat` |
| Runtime state mapping | Passed in validation workspace | `CatController` now cross-fades directly to real Animator state names for Normal/Transition/Focus/Reward |
| Play Mode smoke test | Passed | Entered Play Mode for 5 seconds through MCP; Unity Console reported 0 runtime errors |
| `mainscene` animated cat integration | Passed in validation workspace | Instantiated final FBX as `CatModel_AnimatedMVP`, assigned validation Animator Controller, added orange MVP material, and disabled legacy static cat |
| `mainscene` visual evidence | Passed | Game View screenshot saved at `06-deliverables/unity-handoff-20260629/qa-screenshots/catlife-mvp-main-gameview.png` |

## MCP Validation Evidence

- MCP server reachable on `127.0.0.1:8080`.
- Connected Unity instance: `unity-import-validation-20260629`, hash `33ea0b279916de01`, Unity `6000.4.9f1`.
- Active scene before setup: `Assets/Scenes/startscene.unity`.
- Existing `Cat` GameObject had `CatController` and `Animator`, but no Animator Controller.
- New validation controller clip count: `10`.
- All target clips report `loop=True` after import-setting update.
- `CatController` scene serialized fields were updated from placeholder names (`Idle`, `Walk`, `Rest`) to real action states.
- Core state mapping validation:
  - Normal: `CL_CAT_IdleBreath_v06_headsync_loop_108f`
  - Transition: `CL_CAT_CuriousSniff_v02_loop_112f`
  - Focus: `CL_CAT_IdleBreath_v06_headsync_loop_108f`
  - Reward: `CL_CAT_TailWagHappy_v01_loop_96f`
- Animator `HasState` check passed for all 5 serialized state fields on layer 0.
- `mainscene` was promoted from static placeholder cat to animated MVP cat:
  - Disabled old `CatModel_LegacyStatic`.
  - Instantiated final FBX as `CatModel_AnimatedMVP`.
  - Set runtime height to approximately `1.2m`, grounded at `y=0`.
  - Assigned temporary orange material `CatLife_OrangeCat_MVP`.
  - Added `CatLifeRuntime` with `StateMachine` and `CatAnimationMvpDemo`.
  - Patched `MainSceneController` to cross-fade to the real transition state instead of calling `Animator.Play` with a clip name.
- `mainscene` Play Mode evidence after refresh:
  - State machine reached `Reward`.
  - Animator controller was `CatLife_10Actions_Validation`.
  - Unity Console returned `0` runtime errors.
- Non-blocking console issue: the FBX also contains legacy/source clip `CL_CAT_SRC_BasePose` with 0 frames. This is outside the 10 target clips and should be ignored or removed in a future cleanup pass.

## Created In Local Validation Workspace

These files are inside ignored local workspace `work/unity-import-validation-20260629/` and are not committed:

- `Assets/Art/Cat/Animations/CatLife_10Actions_Validation.controller`
- Updated FBX import `.meta` loop settings for the 10 target clips
- Saved `Assets/Scenes/startscene.unity` with the validation controller assigned to `Cat`
- Updated `Assets/脚本/Cat/CatController.cs` to use direct Animator state playback via `CrossFadeInFixedTime`
- Added `Assets/脚本/Cat/CatAnimationMvpDemo.cs` for automatic Normal -> Transition -> Focus -> Reward playback
- Saved `Assets/Scenes/mainscene.unity` with the animated FBX cat integrated as `CatModel_AnimatedMVP`
- Created `Assets/Art/Cat/Animations/CatLife_OrangeCat_MVP.mat` as a temporary MVP material fallback

## Committed Runtime Patch

The reusable script update is committed separately from the large Unity validation workspace:

- `06-deliverables/unity-handoff-20260629/runtime-patch/CatController.cs`
- `06-deliverables/unity-handoff-20260629/runtime-patch/CatAnimationMvpDemo.cs`
- `06-deliverables/unity-handoff-20260629/runtime-patch/MainSceneManager.cs`
- `06-deliverables/unity-handoff-20260629/runtime-patch/README.md`
- `06-deliverables/unity-handoff-20260629/qa-screenshots/catlife-mvp-main-gameview.png`

Apply this patch by copying `CatController.cs` to:

```text
Assets/脚本/Cat/CatController.cs
Assets/脚本/Cat/CatAnimationMvpDemo.cs
Assets/脚本/MainSceneManager.cs
```

`Assets_noart.zip` was not rebuilt with the validation Animator Controller, because that controller references FBX clip subassets and should be promoted together with the final Unity animation import settings after visual playback review.

## Promoted MVP Unity Assets

The validated Unity text assets are now staged for handoff in:

```text
06-deliverables/unity-handoff-20260629/mvp-unity-assets/
```

This directory preserves Unity `Assets/` paths and `.meta` GUIDs for:

- `Assets/Scenes/mainscene.unity`
- `Assets/Art/Cat/Animations/CatLife_10Actions_Validation.controller`
- `Assets/Art/Cat/Animations/CatLife_cat_10_actions_final_state.fbx.meta`
- `Assets/Art/Cat/Animations/CatLife_OrangeCat_MVP.mat`
- `Assets/脚本/Cat/CatController.cs`
- `Assets/脚本/Cat/CatAnimationMvpDemo.cs`
- `Assets/脚本/MainSceneManager.cs`

The FBX binary is intentionally excluded from this tracked directory. Copy the existing local FBX:

```text
06-deliverables/cat-animation-final-package-20260629/CatLife_cat_10_actions_final_state.fbx
```

to:

```text
Assets/Art/Cat/Animations/CatLife_cat_10_actions_final_state.fbx
```

then copy `mvp-unity-assets/Assets/` over the Unity project `Assets/` directory. Hash verification passed between the local validation project and `mvp-unity-assets` for all promoted text assets.

## Next Step After This Passes

Do visual playback review from the promoted asset directory and continue toward Android build verification:

- Confirm idle, transition sniff, focus idle/listen, and reward tail-wag are visually acceptable in Game view.
- Replace temporary orange material with final texture/material if available.
- Capture a short Unity playback clip for PPT/video material.
- Run Android build validation from Unity `6000.4.9f1` or the project-approved Unity version.
