# CatLife Final Submission Folder

This folder is the canonical destination for final competition deliverables.

Expected files:

- `CatLife_作品介绍PPT_v1.pptx`
- `CatLife_作品演示视频_v1.mp4`
- `CatLife_作品海报_v1.png`
- `CatLife_MVP_Android_v0.1.0.apk`
- `CatLife_大模型调用代码包_v1.zip`
- `CatLife_提交自检表_20260705.md`

Current status: placeholders only. Final APK, video, poster, PPT, and code package are not yet confirmed in this folder.

Official competition constraints currently tracked:

- Video: MP4 preferred; target <=3 minutes, hard maximum <=5 minutes; 1920x1080 landscape or 1080x1920 portrait.
- Poster: portrait 70cm x 150cm; jpg/jpeg/png preferred; must include work name, slogan if any, and promotional visual. The extracted PDF text says the overall size should not be lower than 2M; verify against the upload platform before final export.
- Product file: must be runnable. CatLife targets Android APK.
- Code package: all code or core code is acceptable, but the large-model API call section must be clearly marked.

Use these planning documents before filling the folder:

- `08-handoff-docs/planning/CatLife_最终提交包检查表.md`
- `08-handoff-docs/planning/CatLife_演示视频脚本与镜头表.md`
- `08-handoff-docs/planning/CatLife_作品介绍PPT_10页精修脚本.md`
- `08-handoff-docs/planning/CatLife_海报文案与版式方案.md`
- `08-handoff-docs/planning/CatLife_用户验证访谈与问卷模板.md`
- `07-tech-specs/CatLife_Android打包与真机QA方案.md`
- `07-tech-specs/CatLife_大模型代码包与隐私降级方案.md`

The large-model code package template is prepared at:

- `06-deliverables/llm-code-package-template/`

Package it only after replacing provider-specific API parsing and confirming no secrets are present.

Run the final submission checker after adding real deliverables:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/final-submission/check-final-submission.ps1
```

The checker writes:

- `06-deliverables/final-submission/CatLife_submission_check_20260705.md`

To prepare a draft large-model code package for review:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/final-submission/package-llm-code.ps1
```

By default this writes to `work/llm-code-package-output/`, not to the final submission folder.
